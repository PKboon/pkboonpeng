			recommendation: `I met PK in early 2021, when she interviewed for an internship at Plum Voice. After her interview it was a unanimous decision, we all wanted to offer her the position on the spot. At the time, PK didn't have any familiarity with our technology stack, but she had a strong work ethic and was highly organized. She excelled on all individual projects we assigned her and played key roles on team projects. Her performance as an intern was so strong, we created a position to hire her when the company wasn't ordinarily looking to hire.
			
				As a full time team member, PK took ownership of several internal applications, including tools used by our Development and Support teams. Her early roles were more front-end focused, but she reached out an expressed as desire to take on more back-end responsibilities, with a desire of becoming a more complete engineer. PK was always great about asking for the information she needed to complete her tasks. When I had the opportunity to manage her directly, I appreciated her ability to tell me directly what she needed from me.
				
				Some highlight from her time with Plum:
				- Took a leading role on a team project, due to her strong organizational skills
				- Learned Figma and contributed to improving our UI/UX design process
				- Built a visual design system
				- Suggested workflow improvements in our code review and source control processes
				- Contributed to maintaining a productive and positive team culture
				- Built the company's first Dialogflow-based SMS application
				- Built a site consolidating internal Support tools into a single portal
				- Developed features and bug-fixes for our core product, Plum Fuse
				- Contributed and participated in our skills development program
					
				PK was an extremely valuable member of our team and I'm excited to see how she continues to grow.
